COMP-521-Project
================

Project on influence mapping and potential field pathfinding. The way the AI makes use of this data, and the "combat" mechanic itself can be clunky at times, and they often have trouble pathing around large obstacles like rivers. There are a few settings files that should have been added to the gitignore long ago.
